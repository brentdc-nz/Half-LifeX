# Half-LifeX - Beta 0.90

This is a port of Half-Life 1 to the original Xbox using Xash3D and FakeGLx.

The following included libraries need to be compiled first before building Half-LifeX.

- Client: Using XashXT client as the Valve version has a closed source library for VGUI.
- Server: Using the Valve SDK server library v2.3.
- MenuUI: The main menu for Xash3D to replicate the original WON menu.

### Known Issues:
- Currently only runs on 128MB modded Xboxes. I have some new ideas on ways to manage memory without editing assets to allow it to run on stock 64MB Xboxes, I'm going to attempt latter this year (2023).
Note: There is an older 64MB build out there that runs on stock Xboxes with model textures disabled to allow it to fit into memory.
