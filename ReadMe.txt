==========================
 Half-LifeX Pre-Beta 0.85
==========================

This is a port of Half-Life 1 to the original Xbox using Xash3D and FakeGLx.

The following included libraries need to be compiled first before building Half-LifeX.

Client: Using XashXT client as the Valve version has a closed source library for VGUI.
Server: Using the Valve SDK server library v2.3.
MenuUI: The main menu for Xash3D to replicate the original WON menu.

Currently only runs on 128MB modded xboxes, I will be reducing the memory footprint and attempting to use virtual memory in future releases to allow it to run on stock 64mb Xboxes. 

The port is not finish yet but only minor things need to be completed, this is very playable in it's current state using 128MB modded Xboxes.

Note: Build using FakeGLx01, I have included FakeGLx09 but it's currently not working, I have not fixed it yet as FGLx01 is more suited to this port anyway. I may remove FGLx09 altogether in future.
